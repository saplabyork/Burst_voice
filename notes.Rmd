## Oro-laryngeal timing of English onsets is affected by coda voicing

Hawkins, S., & Nguyen, N. (2004). Influence of syllable-coda voicing on the acoustic properties of syllable-onset/l/in English. Journal of Phonetics, 32(2), 199-231.

Mielke, J., & Nielsen, K. (2018). Voice Onset Time in English voiceless stops is affected by following postvocalic liquids and voiceless onsets. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 144(4), 2166-2177.

Arzbecker, L. J., Jacewicz, E., Goebel, R., & Fox, R. A. (2022, May). Structured covariation of acoustic cues to coda voicing throughout the syllable. In Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics (Vol. 46, No. 1). AIP Publishing.

Choi, J., Kim, S., & Cho, T. (2016). Phonetic encoding of coda voicing contrast under different focus conditions in L1 vs. L2 English. Frontiers in psychology, 7, 624.

It looks like Choi et al. show a simliar effect, though their study is limited to coronal codas. They also don't discuss the possible acoustic/aerodynamic sources of this effect.
